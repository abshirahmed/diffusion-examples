This directory contains examples showing the use of the Apple API for Diffusion and Reappt.

The examples are provided with partial source code, without an Xcode project for build.
As such they are intended to demonstrate typical usage of the API and are agnostic as to their
runtime platform. They will require minimum modification to run on either OS X or iOS.
