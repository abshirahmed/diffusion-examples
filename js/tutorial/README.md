The second video in this series shows how simple it is to create a publish subscribe architecture with Diffusion Cloud, and how this is much more efficient than the traditional REST model.

* REST vs Publish / Subscribe
* Adding Diffusion Cloud System Users
* Creating a Simple Publisher - the publisher will update a topic once per second with an incrementing integer. 
* Creating a Simple Subscriber - the subscriber will print the value of the topic to the browser console.

The third video in this series demonstrates how easy it is to convert a standard JSON REST API into a Push based API, with only the data deltas being sent over the network.

* Create a JSON Topic
* Publish to JSON Topic
* Subscribe to JSON Topic
* Use JSON in application
