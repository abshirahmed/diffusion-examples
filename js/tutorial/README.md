The second video in this series shows how simple it is to create a publish subscribe architecture with Reappt, and how this is much more efficient than the traditional REST model.

* REST vs Publish / Subscribe
* Adding Reappt System Users
* Creating a Simple Publisher - the publisher will update a topic once per second with an incrementing integer. 
* Creating a Simple Subscriber - the subscriber will print the value of the topic to the browser console.
