# Diffusion .NET Client Examples

This directory contains examples showing the use of the Diffusion .NET Client Library.

The `getting-started` directory contains a simple publishing and subscribing client. The `examples` directory contains more in-depth examples that can be run via the `Runner.csproj` project. In order for all examples to work you have to pull in `Diffusion.Client` via NuGet: `dotnet add package Diffusion.Client`.
