# .NET Examples for the Diffusion and Reappt APIs

This directory contains examples showing the use of the .NET API for Diffusion and Reappt.

These examples are all bundled in a Visual Studio 2015 solution file. For the examples to work,
you need to download and reference the ClientInterface assembly. Please download the following files and move 
them into the `dotnet/examples` folder: 

*   PushTechnology.ClientInterface.dll
*   PushTechnology.ClientInterface.XML

No further referencing is required.

The GettingStarted and Examples directories contain runnable files and are included in the dotnet-examples.sln. Select the Publishing and Subscribing projects to run the GettingStarted examples. 
For the rest of the examples, uncomment the appropriate block of code inside the Program.cs to run a particular set of examples.
